# My rustbook

This repository is where I will post all the examples of the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) here I will post and store all my progress of the book.

Rust programming language has caught my attention on the last months, as I am a developer much more focused in embedded solutions, I am first learning the rust programming language on a comfortable and stable environment of my linux x86 notebook so later I can read the [embedded rust book](https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/) and write code using it.

let the fun begin!
